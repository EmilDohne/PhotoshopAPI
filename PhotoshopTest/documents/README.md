# Photoshop Test Documents

This subfolder contains documents showcasing many different aspects and combinations of Photoshop files to ensure **PhotoshopAPI** parses all of these accurately and efficiently.

Please note that all of these tests are generated using Photoshop Version 22.3.2 (Photoshop 2022). In the future I would like to add further versions for testing as well even though Photoshop does not usually change their File Format very frequently.

These documents all get parsed as part of the testing suite, testing both full parsing and correctness of individual sections / algorithms. To allow for all of these test cases to be stored on the repository the individual documents rarely exceed a resolution of 64x64.
