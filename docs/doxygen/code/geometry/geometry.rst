Geometry Structures
----------------------------

The PhotoshopAPI comes with a couple of Geometry (2D) structures to facilitate e.g. the warping of images or to support image transformations.
At the moment these are only used on the SmartObject layers but in the future these could be extended to more generically allow users to transform images.

All of these structures are optimized for speed primarily and not to be the most flexible. Please read the docs carefully!
