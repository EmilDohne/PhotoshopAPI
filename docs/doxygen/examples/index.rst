Examples
============

This section shows all the currently available examples for using the PhotoshopAPI to perform various operations, these can also
be found in the root of the repository under `PhotoshopExamples/`. 

If you feel there is something missing, please make sure to create a ticket on the `github page <https://github.com/EmilDohne/PhotoshopAPI/>`_
and we will gladly add them.

Most examples are for both C++ and Python unless there is a valid reason not to (e.g. missing bindings).
