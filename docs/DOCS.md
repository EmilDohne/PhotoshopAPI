# Documentation

The documentation consists of two parts, for one we have the documentation for the [PhotoshopFileFormat](./PhotoshopFileFormat/README.md) which attempts to offer a more concrete and correct documentation of the file structure of Photoshop Documents as the one presented by Adobe itself is not always correct or complete. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is currently not completed and still a work in progress

The second part is documentation specific to the PhotoshopAPI, this documentation is hosted on [ReadTheDocs](https://photoshopapi.readthedocs.io/)
