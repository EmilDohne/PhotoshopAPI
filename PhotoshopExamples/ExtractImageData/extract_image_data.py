def main() -> None:

    # In the python bindings we expose a wrapper which reads a LayeredFile instance with the
    # correct bit-depth
    layered_file = psapi.LayeredFile.read(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "ImageData.psb"))

    # We can verify this by printing the type of layered_file
    print(type(layered_file))   # <--- Will print psapi.LayeredFile_8bit

    # One massive advantage is that we can use dict-like indexing to retrieve the layers
    img_layer: psapi.ImageLayer_8bit = layered_file["RedLayer"]    

    # and then again for channels
    channel_r = img_layer[0]

    # or if we just want all the data as dict 
    img_data: dict[int, np.ndarray] = img_layer.image_data()
    print(f"Image data retrieved as dict: {img_data}")

    # Similarly we can also extract masks in many different ways
    mask_layer: psapi.ImageLayer_8bit = layered_file["Group"]["EmptyLayerWithMask"]
    mask_data = mask_layer[-2]  # -2 is the index for mask channels
    mask_data = mask_layer.get_channel_by_id(psapi.enum.ChannelID.mask) # If we want to be more explicit
    mask_data = mask_layer.get_mask() 
    # Dont worry if the mask data shows up as empty since photoshop has optimized this mask channel away due to it being full white

    # There is also no reason to actually store the mask layer, we can simply chain indexing calls
    mask_data = layered_file["Group"]["EmptyLayerWithMask"][-2]

    # Now we already knew all the layers' names but if we wish to iterate we can do that too
    for layer in layered_file.layers:

    # Throughout the example so far we omitted a parameter on channel extraction which is
    # the 'do_copy' parameter. Setting it to false means image data isnt copied out but rather
    # extracted which means it is no longer accessible. For an example:
    red_channel = img_layer.get_channel_by_index(0, do_copy=False)
    
    # This would usually raise an error which we can catch but when running on ARM-Based mac systems 
    # this actually segmentation faults and we cannot catch the exception due to the problems mentioned in
    # this issue: https://github.com/EmilDohne/PhotoshopAPI/issues/61
    # try:
    #     # We use another way of indexing for simplicity here to show that all the methods
    #     # are compatible with one another
    #     red_channel_again = img_layer[0]    # This implicitly enables do_copy
    # except RuntimeError:
    #     pass    # The PhotoshopAPI will already complain here
