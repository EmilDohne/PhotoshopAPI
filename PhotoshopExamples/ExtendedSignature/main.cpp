/*
This is the ModifyLayerStructure example but instead of using the simplified read and write signature we use the extend
one to give us direct access to the PhotoshopFile. This is a lot more verbose than the alternative presented in the other examples
The preferred method is always to interact through the LayeredFile
struct rather than directly with the low level PhotoshopAPI::PhotoshopFile although that is also possible but requires a deep understanding of the
underlying structure whereas LayeredFile abstracts the implementation details.
