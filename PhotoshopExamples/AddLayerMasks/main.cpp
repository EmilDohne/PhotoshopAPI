Example of creating a simple document with a single layer using the PhotoshopAPI. The preferred method is always to interact through the LayeredFile
struct rather than directly with the low level PhotoshopAPI::PhotoshopFile although that is also possible but requires a deep understanding of the
underlying structure whereas LayeredFile abstracts the implementation details.
