        Attributes
        -----------

         image_data : dict[int, numpy.ndarray]
            Property: A dictionary of the image data mapped by an int where the channel mapping
            is e.g. [R: 0, G: 1, B: 2]. Accessing this property will decompress and load the image
            data into memory therefore incurring a performance and memory penalty. If you only wish
            to get a list of all the channels use the `num_channels` or `channels` properties instead.

            All channels are the same size except for the mask channel (-2) which may have any size.
        name : str
            The name of the layer, cannot be longer than 255
        blend_mode : enum.BlendMode
            The blend mode of the layer, 'Passthrough' is reserved for group layers
        opacity : int
            The layers opacity from 0-255 with 255 being 100%
        width : int
            The width of the layer ranging up to 30,000 for PSD and 300,000 for PSB,
            this does not have to match the files width
        height : int
            The height of the layer ranging up to 30,000 for PSD and 300,000 for PSB,
            this does not have to match the files height
        center_x : float
            The center of the layer in regards to the canvas, a layer at center_x = 0 is
            perfectly centered around the document
        center_y : float
            The center of the layer in regards to the canvas, a layer at center_y = 0 is
            perfectly centered around the document
        is_locked: bool
            The locked state of the layer, this locks all pixel channels
        is_visible: bool
            Whether the layer is visible
        mask: np.ndarray
            The layers' mask channel, may be empty

            Whether the mask is disabled. Ignored if no mask is present
        mask_relative_to_layer: bool
            Whether the masks position is relative to the layer. Ignored if no mask is present
        mask_default_color: int
            The masks' default color outside of the masks bounding box from 0-255. Ignored if no mask is present
        mask_density: int
            Optional mask density from 0-255, this is equivalent to layers' opacity. Ignored if no mask is present
        mask_feather: float
            Optional mask feather. Ignored if no mask is present
        mask_position: psapi.geometry.Point2D
            The masks' canvas coordinates, these represent the center of the mask in terms of the canvas (file). Ignored if no mask is present

        Construct an image layer from image data passed as numpy.ndarray

        :param image_data: 
            The image data as 2- or 3-Dimensional numpy array where the first dimension is the number of channels.
    
            If its a 2D ndarray the second dimension must hold the image data in row-major order with the size being height*width. 
            An example could be the following shape: (3, 1024) for an RGB layer that is 32*32px. 

            If its a 3D ndarray the second and third dimension hold height and width respectively.
            An example could be the following shape: (3, 32, 32) for the same RGB layer

            We also support adding alpha channels this way, those are always stored as the last channel and are optional. E.g. for RGB
            there could be a ndarray like this (4, 32, 32) and it would automatically identify the last channel as alpha. For the individual
            color modes there is always a set of required channels such as R, G and B for RGB or C, M, Y, K for CMYK with the optional alpha
            that can be appended to the end.

            The size **must** be the same as the width and height parameter
